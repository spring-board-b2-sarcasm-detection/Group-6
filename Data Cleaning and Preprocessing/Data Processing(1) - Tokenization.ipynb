    "Tokenization can be classified into several types based on how the text is segmented. Here are some types of tokenization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Tokenization:\n",
    "Word tokenization divides the text into individual words. Many NLP tasks use this approach, in which words are treated as the basic units of meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \"Tokenization is an important NLP task.\"\n",
    "Output: [\"Tokenization\", \"is\", \"an\", \"important\", \"NLP\", \"task\", \".\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence Tokenization:\n",
    "The text is segmented into sentences during sentence tokenization. This is useful for tasks requiring individual sentence analysis or processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \"Tokenization is an important NLP task. It helps break down text into smaller units.\"\n",
    "Output: [\"Tokenization is an important NLP task.\", \"It helps break down text into smaller units.\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Subword Tokenization:\n",
    "Subword tokenization entails breaking down words into smaller units, which can be especially useful when dealing with morphologically rich languages or rare words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \"tokenization\"\n",
    "Output: [\"token\", \"ization\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Character Tokenization:\n",
    "This process divides the text into individual characters. This can be useful for modelling character-level language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: \"Tokenization\"\n",
    "Output: [\"T\", \"o\", \"k\", \"e\", \"n\", \"i\", \"z\", \"a\", \"t\", \"i\", \"o\", \"n\"]"

    "                                                Need of Tokenization\n",
    "Tokenization is a crucial step in text processing and natural language processing (NLP) for several reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective Text Processing: Tokenization reduces the size of raw text so that it can be handled more easily for processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction: Text data can be represented numerically for algorithmic comprehension by using tokens as features in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language Modelling: Tokenization in NLP facilitates the creation of organized representations of language, which is useful for tasks like text generation and language modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Retrieval: Tokenization is essential for indexing and searching in systems that store and retrieve information efficiently based on words or phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Analysis: Tokenization is used in many NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis and named entity recognition, to determine the function and context of individual words in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vocabulary Management: By generating a list of distinct tokens that stand in for words in the dataset, tokenization helps manage a corpus’s vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task-Specific Adaptation: Tokenization can be customized to meet the needs of particular NLP tasks, meaning that it will work best in applications such as summarization and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing Step: This essential preprocessing step transforms unprocessed text into a format appropriate for additional statistical and computational analysis."

    "What Is Lemmatization?\n",
    "Lemmatization is a text pre-processing technique used in natural language processing (NLP) models to break a word down to its root meaning to identify similarities. For example, a lemmatization algorithm would reduce the word better to its root word, or lemme, good.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming and lemmatization are techniques used in natural language processing to reduce words to their base forms. Stemming involves removing prefixes or suffixes from words, often resulting in the stem not being an actual word. For example, \"running\" would be stemmed to \"run.\" In contrast, lemmatization considers the word's meaning and context, ensuring that the root form (or lemma) is a valid word. For example, \"better\" would be lemmatized to \"good,\" which is its base form. While stemming is simpler and faster, lemmatization is more precise and accurate, making it preferable in many applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming can sometimes be too aggressive, leading to over-stemming or under-stemming, where words are incorrectly reduced or not reduced enough. On the other hand, lemmatization is more complex and requires access to a dictionary or vocabulary to determine the lemma of a word. This additional step makes lemmatization slower than stemming but results in more accurate word reductions. Overall, the choice between stemming and lemmatization depends on the specific requirements of the text processing task and the desired balance between speed and accuracy."
